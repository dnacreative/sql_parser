sql_parser 7.x-1.x, 2010-xx-xx (development version)
------------------------------
- TODO (2010-xx-xx):
  * sql_converter
  * - Create tests with known output for known input
  * - Allow for more than two conditional expressions on a JOIN
  * - Add _toString() method for SqlGroupByClause
  * - Handle presence or absence of each type of clause in adding '$query' to output
  * - Pass extenders to parser

- Changes (2010-12-13):
  * sql_converter
  * - Add $query variable to converted expressions since not all items can be chained together
  * - Handle selecting all fields from multiple tables: SELECT a.*, b.*, c.field1 FROM ..
  * - Eliminate reuse of conditional placeholders from prior JOIN when no placeholders on current JOIN
    - Maintain conditional placeholders separately for different JOIN expressions (SAME AS ABOVE)
